# dictionaries

Dictionary files in this repo are essentially plain-text (non-hash) list files, which are used with "password-crack".

Solely used in infosec-testing environments, where such dictionary files are required. Example "John the Ripper".

Note: Some applications and cli may require the file extension to end in .txt and/or .dic
